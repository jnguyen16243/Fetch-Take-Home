This is a React + Node.js application that allows users to browse available dogs for adoption and match with one based on their favorites.

 How to Use

    Click "Match" to find a match from your favorited dogs.

 Known Issues
Infinite Scroll Re-Fetching

    Infinite scroll re-fetches the same results repeatedly because the loading animation is forced to play.
    The last element stays in view too long, causing re-fetching.

 State Filter Cannot Be Cleared

    The State dropdown does not allow selecting "No State."
You can login on mobile, but no dogs load. 


 TODO
Optimizations

Clicking ascending/descending sort should call the server for a sorted list instead of sorting locally.
Implement caching for sorted results.
 User Experience Improvements

Improve error handling and display messages to users instead of logging to the console.
 Notes

    Hosted frontend on Vercel and backend on Render.
    Uses CORS + cookies for authentication.
